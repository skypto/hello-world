Editing a read-me file as an introduction to a repository branch usage seems to be a classic approach to learning to use GITHUB.

This is the "Hello World" of programming in action hehehe.

# I added a few lines of data to the existing Hello World sheet.

# A new line of code added from the online github repository will not show in local file unless it's synchronized with a pull
